# Rocio
This app will be a cross-platform (Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS, Linux)

## Purpose
An app that helps users track their daily water intake and reminds them to stay hydrated thorughout
the day.

## Requirements
- [ ] The app should be able to allow users to set their daily water intake goals.
- [ ] The app should be able to track progress.
- [ ] The app should be able to send notifications to drink water regularly.
- [ ] The app should be able to provide insights into the benefits of staying hydrated.
- [ ] The app should be able to personalized recommendations based on th user's activity level.
- [ ] The app should be able to personalized recommendations based on th user's environment.

## Ideas to gather information
1. **Data collection**: Collect data from the user, such as their age, weight, height, activity level,
and any specific health conditions that may affect their hydration needs.

2. **Machine Learning Model**: Train a machine learning model using this data to predict the user's daily
water intake requirements. You can use algorithms like regression or neural networks to analyze the data
and make accurate predictions.

3. **User Input**: Allow user to input their daily activites, excercise routines, and enviromental factors
(like temperature and humidity) into the app. This additional information can help refine the AI's calculations.

4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement a feature that tracks the user's water consumption throughout the day. The AI
 can compare this data with the predicted intake requirements and provide real-time feedback to help the user stay
 hydrated.

5. **Personalized Recommendations**: Use the AI to provide persolaized recommendations on when and how much watyer the
user should drink based on their individual needs and habits.

## Programming language
- Python

## Frameworks
- Beeware: for cross-platform compatibility
- Tensorflow /w Keras: for machine learning model, and high-level neural netowrks.

## Design Patterns:
When designing a hydration tracker mobile app, you may want to consider design patterns that are well-suited for mobile development and user interaction. Here are some design patterns commonly used in mobile app development that you could consider for your hydration tracker app:

1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**:
   - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the app, such as hydration goals, water intake records, and user information.
   - **View**: Represents the user interface components, such as the dashboard, input forms, and visualizations for hydration data.
   - **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling user input, updating the model, and updating the view accordingly.

2. **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)**:
   - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
   - **View**: Represents the user interface components.
   - **Presenter**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling user input, updating the model, and updating the view. MVP is often used in Android development.

3. **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**:
   - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
   - **View**: Represents the user interface components.
   - **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, but also exposes data and actions to the view in a way that is easy to bind to the user interface. MVVM is commonly used in iOS development.

4. **Single-Activity Architecture (Android)**:
   - In Android development, you may consider using a single-activity architecture with multiple fragments to manage different screens and components within your app.

5. **Coordinator Pattern**:
   - Helps manage navigation flow and communication between different screens or components in the app. This can be useful for handling transitions between hydration tracking screens, settings, reminders, etc.

6. **Material Design Guidelines (Android)** or **Human Interface Guidelines (iOS)**:
   - While not design patterns in the traditional sense, following platform-specific design guidelines can help ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience for your app users.

## Code sample
It seems like you are referring to the Beeware project, which is a collection of tools and libraries for building native user interfaces in Python. Here is an example of a simple "Beeware" script using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern with Toga, a part of the Beeware project:

Model (model.py):
```python
class BeewareModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.message = "Beeware: This is a Beeware message!"

    def get_message(self):
        return self.message
```

View (view.py):
```python
import toga

class BeewareView(toga.App):
    def startup(self):
        self.main_window = toga.MainWindow(title="Beeware MVC Example")
        self.label = toga.Label("")

        self.main_window.content = self.label
        self.main_window.show()

    def show_message(self, message):
        self.label.text = message
```

Controller (controller.py):
```python
from model import BeewareModel
from view import BeewareView

class BeewareController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = BeewareModel()
        self.view = BeewareView()

    def show_message(self):
        message = self.model.get_message()
        self.view.show_message(message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    controller = BeewareController()
    controller.view.app = controller
    controller.view.main_loop()
```

In this script:
- The Model (BeewareModel) contains the data and business logic.
- The View (BeewareView) is a Toga app that displays the data to the user.
- The Controller (BeewareController) acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, handling user input and updating the View based on changes in the Model.

When you run the controller.py script, it will display the "Beeware: This is a Beeware message!" output in a Toga window. This is a simple example to demonstrate the MVC pattern with Beeware and Toga in action.

## Views
For a hydration tracker mobile app, you can create the following views to provide a user-friendly and intuitive experience:

1. **Home Screen**:
   - Display daily water intake progress.
   - Show a summary of water consumed and remaining target.
   - Include a quick add button to log water intake easily.

2. **Log Water Intake Screen**:
   - Allow users to manually log their water intake.
   - Provide options to select the amount of water consumed (e.g., glass, bottle, custom amount).
   - Include a timestamp for each entry.

3. **Hydration History Screen**:
   - Show a log of water intake entries over time.
   - Display daily, weekly, or monthly water intake trends using graphs or charts.
   - Allow users to view and edit past entries.

4. **Reminders Screen**:
   - Enable users to set reminders to drink water at regular intervals.
   - Provide customization options for reminder frequency and timing.
   - Allow users to snooze or dismiss reminders.

5. **Settings Screen**:
   - Allow users to customize their daily water intake goal.
   - Provide options to set units of measurement (e.g., ounces, liters).
   - Include theme customization and app preferences.

6. **Achievements Screen**:
   - Gamify the hydration tracking experience with achievements and milestones.
   - Reward users for reaching hydration goals or maintaining consistency.
   - Encourage healthy hydration habits through positive reinforcement.

7. **Profile Screen**:
   - Allow users to set up their profile with personal information like age, weight, and activity level.
   - Provide insights or recommendations based on user data to optimize hydration goals.
   - Enable users to sync data across devices or platforms.

These views can help users track their water intake effectively, stay motivated to reach their hydration goals, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Consider incorporating user feedback and usability testing to refine the views and enhance the overall user experience of your hydration tracker mobile app.

## Sample of using sqlite3 with Beeware
Yes, you can use SQLite with Beeware to create mobile apps that require local data storage on the device. SQLite is a popular choice for mobile app development due to its lightweight nature and compatibility with various platforms, including iOS and Android.

To use SQLite with Beeware for a mobile app, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Set up SQLite Database**:
   - Create an SQLite database file (.db or .sqlite) to store your app's data locally on the mobile device.

2. **Integrate SQLite in Beeware App**:
   - Use the `sqlite3` module in Python to interact with the SQLite database.
   - Connect to the SQLite database, execute SQL queries, and manage data storage and retrieval.

3. **Design User Interface**:
   - Create views and components using Toga to build the user interface for your mobile app.
   - Design screens for data input, display, and interaction with the SQLite database.

4. **Implement Business Logic**:
   - Develop the logic to handle data operations, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data in the SQLite database.
   - Ensure proper error handling and data validation to maintain data integrity.

5. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Test your mobile app on different devices and platforms to ensure compatibility and functionality.
   - Package your Beeware app for distribution on mobile app stores or deployment on mobile devices.

Here is a simple example of using SQLite in a Beeware mobile app:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a table
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, email TEXT)''')

# Insert data into the table
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'))

# Retrieve data from the table
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Commit changes and close connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

By following these steps, you can effectively use SQLite with Beeware to develop mobile apps that leverage local data storage capabilities for efficient data management on mobile devices.

## Can I use Keras with TensorFlow Lite?

**Yes, you can definitely leverage Keras models for deployment with TensorFlow Lite.** Here's a breakdown of the process:

**1. Train Your Model in Keras:**
   - Create your machine learning model using the familiar Keras API.
   - Train it on your dataset to achieve the desired performance.

**2. Save the Model (Optional but Recommended):**
   - While TensorFlow Lite can convert directly from Keras models, saving it as a SavedModel format is generally recommended for better compatibility and flexibility:
     ```python
     import tensorflow as tf

     model = your_keras_model  # Assuming you have your trained Keras model

     # Save as SavedModel (recommended)
     tf.saved_model.save(model, 'saved_model')
     ```

**3. Convert the Model to TensorFlow Lite:**
   - Use the `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter` class to convert your Keras model or SavedModel into a TensorFlow Lite format suitable for deployment on mobile and embedded devices:
     ```python
     import tensorflow as tf

     converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)  # Or from_saved_model('saved_model')

     # (Optional) Apply optimizations like quantization for smaller model size and faster inference
     converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]

     tflite_model = converter.convert()

     # Save the converted TensorFlow Lite model
     with open('converted_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
         f.write(tflite_model)
     ```

**4. Load and Use the TensorFlow Lite Model in Your Application:**
   - Integrate the converted TensorFlow Lite model (`converted_model.tflite`) into your mobile or embedded application using the appropriate TensorFlow Lite runtime for your target platform.
   - Perform inference (make predictions) on new data using the loaded TensorFlow Lite model.

**Key Points:**

- TensorFlow Lite might not support all Keras operations directly. If you encounter conversion errors, you might need to modify your Keras model architecture or explore alternative implementations. Refer to the TensorFlow Lite compatibility guide for more details: [https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_compatibility](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_compatibility)
- Consider optimizations like quantization during conversion to reduce model size and improve inference speed on resource-constrained devices.

By following these steps, you can effectively leverage the power of Keras for model development and seamlessly deploy your trained models for on-device inference using TensorFlow Lite.
