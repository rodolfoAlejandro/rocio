# Rocio
This app will be a cross-platform (Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS, Linux)

## Purpose
An app that helps users track their daily water intake and reminds them to stay hydrated thorughout
the day.

## Requirements
- [ ] The app should be able to allow users to set their daily water intake goals.
- [ ] The app should be able to track progress.
- [ ] The app should be able to send notifications to drink water regularly.
- [ ] The app should be able to provide insights into the benefits of staying hydrated.
- [ ] The app should be able to personalized recommendations based on th user's activity level.
- [ ] The app should be able to personalized recommendations based on th user's environment.

## Ideas to gather information
1. **Data collection**: Collect data from the user, such as their age, weight, height, activity level,
and any specific health conditions that may affect their hydration needs.

2. **Machine Learning Model**: Train a machine learning model using this data to predict the user's daily
water intake requirements. You can use algorithms like regression or neural networks to analyze the data
and make accurate predictions.

3. **User Input**: Allow user to input their daily activites, excercise routines, and enviromental factors
(like temperature and humidity) into the app. This additional information can help refine the AI's calculations.

4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement a feature that tracks the user's water consumption throughout the day. The AI
 can compare this data with the predicted intake requirements and provide real-time feedback to help the user stay
 hydrated.

5. **Personalized Recommendations**: Use the AI to provide persolaized recommendations on when and how much watyer the
user should drink based on their individual needs and habits.

## Programming language
- Python

## Frameworks
- Beeware: for cross-platform compatibility
- Tensorflow /w Keras: for machine learning model, and high-level neural netowrks.

## Design Patterns:
When designing a hydration tracker mobile app, you may want to consider design patterns that are well-suited for mobile development and user interaction. Here are some design patterns commonly used in mobile app development that you could consider for your hydration tracker app:

1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**:
   - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the app, such as hydration goals, water intake records, and user information.
   - **View**: Represents the user interface components, such as the dashboard, input forms, and visualizations for hydration data.
   - **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling user input, updating the model, and updating the view accordingly.

2. **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)**:
   - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
   - **View**: Represents the user interface components.
   - **Presenter**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling user input, updating the model, and updating the view. MVP is often used in Android development.

3. **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**:
   - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
   - **View**: Represents the user interface components.
   - **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, but also exposes data and actions to the view in a way that is easy to bind to the user interface. MVVM is commonly used in iOS development.

4. **Single-Activity Architecture (Android)**:
   - In Android development, you may consider using a single-activity architecture with multiple fragments to manage different screens and components within your app.

5. **Coordinator Pattern**:
   - Helps manage navigation flow and communication between different screens or components in the app. This can be useful for handling transitions between hydration tracking screens, settings, reminders, etc.

6. **Material Design Guidelines (Android)** or **Human Interface Guidelines (iOS)**:
   - While not design patterns in the traditional sense, following platform-specific design guidelines can help ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience for your app users.

## Code sample
It seems like you are referring to the Beeware project, which is a collection of tools and libraries for building native user interfaces in Python. Here is an example of a simple "Beeware" script using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern with Toga, a part of the Beeware project:

Model (model.py):
```python
class BeewareModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.message = "Beeware: This is a Beeware message!"

    def get_message(self):
        return self.message
```

View (view.py):
```python
import toga

class BeewareView(toga.App):
    def startup(self):
        self.main_window = toga.MainWindow(title="Beeware MVC Example")
        self.label = toga.Label("")

        self.main_window.content = self.label
        self.main_window.show()

    def show_message(self, message):
        self.label.text = message
```

Controller (controller.py):
```python
from model import BeewareModel
from view import BeewareView

class BeewareController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = BeewareModel()
        self.view = BeewareView()

    def show_message(self):
        message = self.model.get_message()
        self.view.show_message(message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    controller = BeewareController()
    controller.view.app = controller
    controller.view.main_loop()
```

In this script:
- The Model (BeewareModel) contains the data and business logic.
- The View (BeewareView) is a Toga app that displays the data to the user.
- The Controller (BeewareController) acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, handling user input and updating the View based on changes in the Model.

When you run the controller.py script, it will display the "Beeware: This is a Beeware message!" output in a Toga window. This is a simple example to demonstrate the MVC pattern with Beeware and Toga in action.
