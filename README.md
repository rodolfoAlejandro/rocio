This app will start as a web application to track the hydration of an individual.

Purpose:
An app that helps users track their daily water intake and reminds them to stay hydrated thorughout
the day.

Key requirements:
- [ ] The app should be able to allow users to set their daily water intake goals.
- [ ] The app should be able to track progress.
- [ ] The app should be able to send notifications to drink water regularly.
- [ ] The app should be able to provide insights into the benefits of staying hydrated.
- [ ] The app should be able to personalized recommendations based on th user's activity level.
- [ ] The app should be able to personalized recommendations based on th user's environment.

Ideas to gather information:
1. **Data collection**: Collect data from the user, suchh as their age, weight, height, activity level,
and any specific health conditions that may affect their hydration needs.

2. **Machine Learning Model**: Train a machine learning model using this data to predict the user's daily
water intake requirements. You can use algorithms like regression or neural networks to analyze the data
and make accurate predictions.

3. **User Input**: Allow user to input their daily activites, excercise routines, and enviromental factors
(like temperature and humidity) into the app. This additional information can help refine the AI's calculations.

4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement a feature that tracks the user's water consumption throughout the day. The AI
 can compare this data with the predicted intake requirements and provide real-time feedback to help the user stay
 hydrated.

5. **Personalized Recommendations**: Use the AI to provide persolaized recommendations on when and how much watyer the
user should drink based on their individual needs and habits.
